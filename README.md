# Lazy related work

I am too lazy to write related work.

## How to use this

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ruotianluo/lazy_related_work
```

run
```
iamlazy $PAPER_TITLE
```

for example:
```
iamlazy 'mask rcnn'
```

It will return ten papers that cite mask rcnn, and print all the places that the paper talks about mask rcnn.

## Known problems
Google scholar doesn't like lazy people, so quickly it will block you from doing it. So, start writing your related work earlier.
